# Tower of Hanoi Game

This is a simple implementation of the Tower of Hanoi game in C++. The Tower of Hanoi is a classic problem that involves moving a stack of disks from one rod to another, following specific rules.

## How to Play

1. Enter the number of disks you want to start the game with.
2. The program will display each move as it solves the Tower of Hanoi problem.
3. The final state of the towers and the total number of moves will be shown.

## Implementation Details

The implementation uses a recursive algorithm to solve the Tower of Hanoi problem. Stacks are represented using a custom `Stackt` class.

## Files

- `main.cpp`: The main C++ file containing the Tower of Hanoi game implementation.
- `Stackt.h`: The header file for the custom `Stackt` class.

## Usage

1. Compile the program using a C++ compiler.
   ```bash
   g++ main.cpp -o hanoi
